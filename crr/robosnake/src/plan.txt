This is a rework of my initial submission based on feedback and learning more about typescript and how it works. I now have an Agent interface that implements a function called 'agent' which takes a 'ScreenPart' and returns a 'Motion'. Building a class to implement this interface will be up to the players. This will allow players to write their individual classes with unique methods and unique members that can be used to generate a 'Motion' in anyway they choose. The only similarity that the players have will be the interface implementation. This is much simpler than my previous submission and I think it's a much better piece of code for that reason. So far it's worked in my testing but I'd love any feedback or critques that you may have. Thanks!
