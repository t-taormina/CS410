# Four-Function Calculator

This is a simple four-function calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It may later be expanded to support more operations and to support multiple different calculator instances on the same page.

## Setup

The setup process is the same for all the code projects in this course, as explained in the TypeScript intro project at <https://gitlab.cecs.pdx.edu/cas28/typescript-intro>.

## Building

There are some `npm` scripts set up for this project, which you can run in any terminal environment with `npm` installed.

- `npm run lint` runs ESLint on the project, reporting warnings and errors in the console.
- `npm run docs` builds the HTML documentation for the project, outputting to the `docs/` folder.
- `npm run build` builds the project, outputting to the `build/` folder.
- `npm run test` tests the project, outputting to the terminal.
- `npm run clean` removes all build artifacts.
- `npm run clean-deps` removes all build artifacts and all dependencies installed for the project.
